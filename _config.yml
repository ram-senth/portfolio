  I'm passionate about using machines and data to solve real-world problems. I have an 
  extensive Software engineering experience. Now I'm also building up knowledge and skillsets 
  in the data science and machine learning realms. This project portfolio covers the 
  projects I have worked on as part of the 
  <a href="https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/" target="_new" Masters In Data Science </a> degree 
  from University of California, Berkeley.
